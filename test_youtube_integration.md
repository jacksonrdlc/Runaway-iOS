- Maintains same UI/UX but with dynamic content

## Result:
The user's request has been fulfilled: **"why am i seeing pre-selected videos? i want the search done every time the research loads"**

The app now performs fresh YouTube searches every time the research page loads, providing real, dynamic content instead of pre-selected videos.
